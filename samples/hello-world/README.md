Hello World sample web application
==================================

JS sample application to showcase the usage of WebRTComm library. The server part is implemented with NodeJS (check server.js) and the html page is index.html. Notice that https is used to overcome the restriction in newer browsers that getUserMedia() only works from secure origins.

Moreover, webrtcomm and jain-sip js libraries are copied at js/lib to make deployment easier for now. For latest versions, please refer to https://github.com/Mobicents/webrtcomm and https://github.com/Mobicents/webrtcomm/tree/master/jain-sip-js
